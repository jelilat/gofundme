# Crowdfunding Module

As blockchain technology gains more popularity and increases in adoption, it opens up a new era of crowdfunding. 

More people are openly funding open-source projects and itâ€™s easier than ever for builders to receive funding for their projects from across the globe irrespective of their location. This is something that is almost impossible with the traditional crowdfunding platforms.

In this tutorial, you will learn some basic crowdfunding model and use Starport to build a crowdfunding module of your own.

**You will learn how to**

* Scaffold a blockchain
* Scaffold a Cosmos SDK crowdfund module
* Scaffold a list for crowdfund objects
* Create messages in the crowdfund module to interact with the crowdfund object
* Interact with other Cosmos SDK modules
* Use an escrow module account
* Add application messages for a crowdfund system
* Create a crowdfunding campaign
* Donate to a crowdfunding campaign
* Withdraw funds from a crowdfunding campaign

**Note:** *The code in this tutorial is written specifically for this learning experience and is intended only for educational purposes. This tutorial code is not intended to be used in production.*

## Module Design

A crowdfunding campaign consists of: 

* An `id`
* The `goal` of the campaign
* The `start` and `end` of the campaign
* The `totaldonations` made towards the campaign
* The `claim` of the campaign that describes the status as:
    * `yes` if the donations have been withdrawn
    * `no` if the donations have not been withdrawn
* The amount of `donation` made by an individual to the campaign
* The `donor` of the donation
* The `creator` of the campaign

### The Creator

A Creator creates a crowdfunding campaign with the following information:

* `goal`
* `start`
* `end`

The Creator can create a campaign and also donate to the campaign. However, the Creator can only withdraw funds from the campaign if the goal was met before the `end` date. 

### The Donor

A Donor donates to a crowdfunding campaign with the following information:

* `id` of the campaign
* `donation`

If the goal of the campaign is not met before the `end` date, the `Donor`s can withdraw their `donation`s from the campaign.

## Scaffold the Blockchain

Use Starport to scaffold a fully functional Cosmos SDK blockchain app named `gofundme`.

```
starport scaffold chain github.com/cosmonaut/gofundme --no-module
```

The `--no-module` flag prevents scaffolding a default module. Don't worry, you will add the `gofundme` module later.

Go into the newly created `gofundme` directory:

```golang
cd gofundme
``` 
## Scaffold the Module

Scaffold the module to create a new `gofundme` module. Following the Cosmos SDK convention, all modules are scaffolded inside the `x` directory:

```
starport scaffold module gofundme --dep bank
```

Use the `--dep` flag to specify that this module depends on and is going to interact with the Cosmos SDK `bank` module.

## Scaffold a List

Use the [scaffold list](https://docs.starport.com/cli/#starport-scaffold-list) command to scaffold code necessary to store `gofundme` campaigns in an array-like data structure:

```
starport scaffold list gofundme creator goal:uint start end totaldonations:uint claim donation:array.string donor:array.string --no-message
```

By default, each variable defined in the list is a `string` type. You can change the type of the variable by using the `:` flag. For example, to change the type of the `goal` variable to `uint`, use the `goal:uint` flag.

Make `donor` and `donation` variables an array of string using the `:array.string` flag. This is necessary to store all the `donor`s and their `donation` information in an array.

Use the `--no-message` flag to disable CRUD messages in the scaffold.

The data you store in an array-like data structure are the `gofundme` campaigns. You can see the parameters defined above in the `Gofundme` message in proto/gofundme/gofundme.proto:

```
message Gofundme {
  uint64 id = 1;
  string creator = 2; 
  uint64 goal = 3; 
  string start = 4; 
  string end = 5; 
  uint64 totaldonations = 6; 
  string claim = 7; 
  repeated string donation = 8; 
  repeated string donor = 9; 
  
}
```

Now, it is time to use messages to interact with the gofundme module. But first, make sure to store your current state in a git commit:

```golang
git add .
git commit -m "Scaffold gofundme and list modules" 
```

## Scaffold the Messages

In order to create a gofundme app, you need the following messages:

* Create Gofundme
* Donate to Gofundme
* Withdraw Donation

You can use the `starport scaffold message` command to create each of the messages. Define the details of each message when you scaffold them.

Create the messages one at a time with the following application logic.

### Create Gofundme

For a gofundme, the initial message handles the transaction when a cosmonaut creates a gofundme campaign.

The cosmonaut needs a certain amount of funds and is requesting donations from other cosmonauts.

The first message is the create-gofundme message that requires these input parameters:

* `goal`: The amount of funds the cosmonaut is requesting
* `start`: The start date of the gofundme campaign
* `end`: The end date of the gofundme campaign

Create a message with the following command:

```
starport scaffold message create-gofundme goal:uint start end 
```
Define the `goal` as a `uint` and the `start` and `end` as `string` types.

The `create-gofundme` message creates a new campaign and stores it in the `gofundme` list. Describe the logic of the message in `x/gofundme/keeper/msg_server_create_gofundme.go`.

```golang
package keeper

import (
	"context"

	"github.com/cosmonaut/gofundme/x/gofundme/types"
	sdk "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types"
)

func (k msgServer) CreateGofundme(goCtx context.Context, msg *types.MsgCreateGofundme) (*types.MsgCreateGofundmeResponse, error) {
	ctx := sdk.UnwrapSDKContext(goCtx)

	// Start a gofundme with the following user input
	var gofundme = types.Gofundme{
		Creator: msg.Creator,
		Goal:    msg.Goal,
		Start:   msg.Start,
		End:     msg.End,
		Claim:   "no",
	}

    //Allow users to set their gofundme campaign start date to be current time
	if gofundme.Start == "now" {
		gofundme.Start = ctx.BlockTime().Format("2006-01-02T15:04:05.000000000")
	}

	// Add the gofundme to the keeper
	k.AppendGofundme(ctx, gofundme)

	return &types.MsgCreateGofundmeResponse{}, nil
}
```
When a `gofundme` campaign is created, a certain input validation is required. You want to throw error messages in case the end user tries impossible inputs.

You can describe message validation errors in the modules types directory.

Add the following code to the ValidateBasic() function in the `/x/gofundme/types/message_create_gofundme.go` file:

```golang
func (msg *MsgCreateGofundme) ValidateBasic() error {
	// Validate the creator
	_, err := sdk.AccAddressFromBech32(msg.Creator)
	if err != nil {
		return sdkerrors.Wrapf(sdkerrors.ErrInvalidAddress, "invalid creator address (%s)", err)
	}

	// Get the goal amount
	goal := sdk.NewIntFromUint64(msg.Goal)

	// Ensure that the goal amount is greater than 0
	if goal.IsZero() {
		return sdkerrors.Wrap(sdkerrors.ErrInvalidRequest, "goal amount must be greater than 0")
	}

	var start time.Time
	//Get the start date
	if msg.Start != "now" {
		startDate, err := sdk.ParseTimeBytes([]byte(msg.Start))
		if err != nil {
			return err
		}
		start = startDate
	} else {
		start = time.Now()
	}

	//Get the end date
	end, err := sdk.ParseTimeBytes([]byte(msg.End))
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	// Get the current block time
	blockTime := time.Now()

	// Ensure that end date is in the future
	if end.Before(blockTime) {
		return sdkerrors.Wrap(sdkerrors.ErrInvalidRequest, "end date must be in the future")
	}

    //Ensure that start date is not in the past
	if start.Before(blockTime) {
		return sdkerrors.Wrap(sdkerrors.ErrInvalidRequest, "start date cannot be in the past")
	}

	// Ensure that start date is before end date
	if start.After(end) {
		return sdkerrors.Wrap(sdkerrors.ErrInvalidRequest, "start date must be before end date")
	}
	return nil
}

```
Congratulations, you have created the `create-gofundme` message.

You can run the chain and test your first message.

Open a new CLI to start the blockchain:
```
starport chain serve
```
Create your first gofundme campaign:
```
gofundmed tx gofundme create-gofundme 100 2022-04-02T15:04:05.000000000 2022-05-02T15:04:05.000000000 --from alice
```
You can also experiment with invalid inputs to see how the validator will throw errors.

Query your gofundme campaign:
```
gofundmed query gofundme list-gofundme
```
The output should be:
```
Gofundme:
- claim: "no"
  creator: cosmos180m28ygyt3gapllfq0mgy28na6uzfs9hjggk9f
  donation: []
  donor: []
  end: 2022-05-02T15:04:05.000000000
  goal: "100"
  id: "0"
  start: 2022-04-02T15:04:05.000000000
  totaldonations: "0"
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
```
If you encounter any error, you can restart your chain and try again.

You can stop the blockchain again with `CTRL+C` or `CMND+C`.

This is a good time to add your advancements to git:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Scaffold create-gofundme message"
```

### Donate to Gofundme Campaign

After a gofundme campaign is created, other cosmonauts can donate to it. 

The next message is the `donate-fund` message that requires these input parameters:

* `id`: The id of the gofundme campaign
* `donation`: The amount of funds an account is donating

Create the `donate-fund` message with the following command:

```
starport scaffold message donate-fund id:uint donation
```
`id`s are stored as a `uint` by default. Therefore, you need to define the `id` as a `uint` type.

This message adds a new donation to the `gofundme` campaign. Describe the logic of the message in `x/gofundme/keeper/msg_server_donate_fund.go`.

```golang
package keeper

import (
	"context"

	"github.com/cosmonaut/gofundme/x/gofundme/types"
	sdk "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types"
	sdkerrors "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types/errors"
)

func (k msgServer) DonateFund(goCtx context.Context, msg *types.MsgDonateFund) (*types.MsgDonateFundResponse, error) {
	ctx := sdk.UnwrapSDKContext(goCtx)

	gofundme, found := k.GetGofundme(ctx, msg.Id)
	if !found {
		return nil, sdkerrors.Wrapf(sdkerrors.ErrKeyNotFound, "gofundme campaign with id %s not found", msg.Id)
	}

	//Get the start date
	start, err := sdk.ParseTimeBytes([]byte(gofundme.Start))
	if err != nil {
		return nil, sdkerrors.Wrap(sdkerrors.ErrInvalidRequest, err.Error())
	}

	//Get the end date
	end, err := sdk.ParseTimeBytes([]byte(gofundme.End))
	if err != nil {
		return nil, sdkerrors.Wrap(sdkerrors.ErrInvalidRequest, err.Error())
	}

	//Check whether the current time is between the start and end date
	if ctx.BlockTime().Before(start) || ctx.BlockTime().After(end) {
		return nil, sdkerrors.Wrap(sdkerrors.ErrInvalidRequest, "gofundme campaign is not active")
	}

	//Get the donor's address
	donor, err := sdk.AccAddressFromBech32(msg.Creator)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, sdkerrors.Wrapf(sdkerrors.ErrInvalidAddress, "invalid donor address (%s)", donor)
	}
	//Get the donation amount
	donation, _ := sdk.ParseCoinsNormalized(msg.Donation)

	//Ensure that the donation amount is greater than 0
	if donation.IsZero() {
		return nil, sdkerrors.Wrap(sdkerrors.ErrInvalidRequest, "donation amount must be greater than 0")
	}

	//Update the gofundme status
	gofundme.Donor = append(gofundme.Donor, msg.Creator)
	gofundme.Donation = append(gofundme.Donation, msg.Donation)
	gofundme.Totaldonations += donation[0].Amount.Uint64()

	//Use the module account as an escrow account
	sdkError := k.bankKeeper.SendCoinsFromAccountToModule(ctx, donor, types.ModuleName, donation)
	if sdkError != nil {
		return nil, sdkError
	}

	k.SetGofundme(ctx, gofundme)

	return &types.MsgDonateFundResponse{}, nil
}
```
The module uses the `SendCoinsFromAccountToModule` function of `bankKeeper`. Add this `SendCoinsFromAccountToModule` to the `x/gofundme/types/expected_keepers.go` file to get rid of the error.

```golang
type BankKeeper interface {
	SpendableCoins(ctx sdk.Context, addr sdk.AccAddress) sdk.Coins
	SendCoinsFromAccountToModule(ctx sdk.Context, senderAddr sdk.AccAddress, recipientModule string, amt sdk.Coins) error
}
```
Start the blockchain and use the two commands you already have available:

```
starport chain serve -r
```
Use the `-r` flag to reset the blockchain state and start with a new database.

Now, let `alice` create a gofundme campaign:
```
gofundmed tx gofundme create-gofundme 100 now 2022-05-02T15:04:05.000000000 --from alice
```
Start the campaign immediately by setting the `start` date to `now`.

Query your gofundme campaign:
```
gofundmed query gofundme list-gofundme
```

Donate to `alice`'s gofundme campaign:
```
gofundmed tx gofundme donate-fund 0 100token --from bob
```
This donates 100 tokens to `alice`'s gofundme campaign.

Query the gofundme campaign again:
```
Gofundme:
- claim: "no"
  creator: cosmos16fjh2va2drgnulxcnpeqcu6wzmhsajgwx3syqy
  donation:
  - 100token
  donor:
  - cosmos16usfuwy7ggaqua0k9ey2rmws09xgyr090yyrdx
  end: 2022-05-02T15:04:05.000000000
  goal: "100"
  id: "0"
  start: 2022-03-15T14:56:51.559035000
  totaldonations: "100"
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
```
You see that `totaldonations` is now 100. The `donor` and `donation` lists have also been updated.

Play around with it and try donating different amounts to see how the total donations change.

This is a good time to save the state with a git commit:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Add donate-fund message"
```

### Withdraw Donation Message

After the campaign is over, you can withdraw the funds. If the campaign goal is met, the funds are transferred to the creator of the campaign. Otherwise, donors can initiate a refund.

Scaffold the message `withdraw-donation` with the following command:
```
starport scaffold message withdraw-donation id:uint
```

Withdrawing donations requires that the campaign is over and `claim` is set to `no`. If these conditions are met, then `donation` is released from the escrow module account.

The withdrawal logic is defined in the `x/gofundme/keeper/message_server_withdraw_donation.go` file.

```golang
package keeper

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	"strconv"

	"github.com/cosmonaut/gofundme/x/gofundme/types"
	sdk "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types"
	sdkerrors "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types/errors"
)

func (k msgServer) WithdrawDonation(goCtx context.Context, msg *types.MsgWithdrawDonation) (*types.MsgWithdrawDonationResponse, error) {
	ctx := sdk.UnwrapSDKContext(goCtx)

	gofundme, found := k.GetGofundme(ctx, msg.Id)
	if !found {
		return nil, sdkerrors.Wrapf(sdkerrors.ErrKeyNotFound, "gofundme with id %s not found", msg.Id)
	}

	//Confirm that the donations have not been claimed
	if gofundme.Claim == "yes" {
		return nil, sdkerrors.Wrapf(sdkerrors.ErrUnauthorized, "gofundme with id %s has already been claimed", msg.Id)
	}

	//Get the end date
	_, err := sdk.ParseTimeBytes([]byte(gofundme.End))
	if err != nil {
		return nil, sdkerrors.Wrap(sdkerrors.ErrInvalidRequest, "Can't withdraw donations until the end of the gofundme campaign.")
	}

	//Get gofundme creator and message sender
	creator := sdk.AccAddress(gofundme.Creator)
	messageSender := sdk.AccAddress(msg.Creator)

	//Get total donations and gofundme goal
	totalDonations := gofundme.Totaldonations
	goal := gofundme.Goal
	stringTotalDonation := strconv.FormatUint(totalDonations, 10)
	normalizedTotalDonation, _ := sdk.ParseCoinsNormalized(stringTotalDonation)
	fmt.Print(creator, messageSender)

	//Ensure that creator can withdraw only if the goal was met
	if creator.Equals(messageSender) && totalDonations < goal {
		return nil, sdkerrors.Wrap(sdkerrors.ErrInvalidRequest, "Can't withdraw donations because goal wasn't met.")
	}

	if creator.Equals(messageSender) && totalDonations >= goal {
		gofundme.Claim = "yes"
		sdkError := k.bankKeeper.SendCoinsFromModuleToAccount(ctx, types.ModuleName, creator, normalizedTotalDonation)
		if sdkError != nil {
			return nil, sdkError
		}
	}

	//Ensure that donor can withdraw only if goal wasn't met
	if !creator.Equals(messageSender) && totalDonations >= goal {
		return nil, sdkerrors.Wrap(sdkerrors.ErrUnauthorized, "Only the owner of the crowdfund can withdraw donations")
	}

	if !creator.Equals(messageSender) && totalDonations < goal {
		var index int
		for idx, v := range gofundme.Donation {
			if v == msg.Creator {
				index = idx
				break
			}
		}
		donation := gofundme.Donation[index]
		normalizedDonation, _ := sdk.ParseCoinsNormalized(donation)

		//Ensure that donor can only withdraw once
		if normalizedDonation.IsZero() {
			return nil, sdkerrors.Wrap(sdkerrors.ErrInvalidRequest, "Donation already withdrawn")
		}
		//Update the donation amount to zero to reflect that the donation was withdrawn
		gofundme.Donation[index] = "0"
		sdkError := k.bankKeeper.SendCoinsFromModuleToAccount(ctx, types.ModuleName, messageSender, normalizedDonation)
		if sdkError != nil {
			return nil, sdkError
		}
	}

	k.SetGofundme(ctx, gofundme)

	return &types.MsgWithdrawDonationResponse{}, nil
}

```

The module uses the `SendCoinsFromModuleToAccount` function of `bankKeeper`. Add this `SendCoinsFromModuleToAccount` to the `x/gofundme/types/expected_keepers.go` file to get rid of the error.

```golang
type BankKeeper interface {
	SpendableCoins(ctx sdk.Context, addr sdk.AccAddress) sdk.Coins
	SendCoinsFromAccountToModule(ctx sdk.Context, senderAddr sdk.AccAddress, recipientModule string, amt sdk.Coins) error
	SendCoinsFromModuleToAccount(ctx sdk.Context, senderModule string, recipientAddr sdk.AccAddress, amt sdk.Coins) error
}
```
Now, start the blockchain again to test all your code.
```
starport chain serve -r
```
Create a new gofundme campaign with the following command:
```
gofundmed tx gofundme create-gofundme 100 now 2022-05-02T15:04:05.000000000 --from alice
```
Start the campaign immediately by setting the `start` date to `now`. to test this out immediately, ensure that the `end` date is only a few minutes from now.

Query your gofundme campaign:
```
gofundmed query gofundme list-gofundme
```

Donate to `alice`'s gofundme campaign:
```
gofundmed tx gofundme donate-fund 0 100token --from bob
```
This donates 100 tokens to `alice`'s gofundme campaign.

Query the gofundme campaign again:
```
Gofundme:
- claim: "no"
  creator: cosmos16fjh2va2drgnulxcnpeqcu6wzmhsajgwx3syqy
  donation:
  - 100token
  donor:
  - cosmos16usfuwy7ggaqua0k9ey2rmws09xgyr090yyrdx
  end: 2022-05-02T15:04:05.000000000
  goal: "100"
  id: "0"
  start: 2022-03-15T14:56:51.559035000
  totaldonations: "100"
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
```

Withdraw your donations:
```
gofundmed tx gofundme withdraw-donation 0 --from alice
```
Query the gofundme campaign again:
```
Gofundme:
- claim: "yes"
  creator: cosmos176zax4hdqrpda3qcv8h2vwhsugc7u64z4nvs77
  donation:
  - 100token
  donor:
  - cosmos1zajjgdkx8jgckrpja0a2qhl853sjf0x25py4cl
  end: 2022-03-15T16:53:05.000000000
  goal: "100"
  id: "0"
  start: 2022-03-15T15:52:43.369278000
  totaldonations: "100"
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
```
You see that `claim` is now `yes`. If you try withdrawing your donations again, you will get an error.

Play around with it and you'll see how our validations work.

Consider again updating your local repository with a git commit. After you test and use your loan module, consider publishing your code to a public repository for others to see your accomplishments.

```
git add .
git commit -m "Add withdraw-donation module"
```
